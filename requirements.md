PUT	/api/properties/:id	Update property (Host only)
DELETE	/api/properties/:id	Delete property (Host only)
Input / Output Specification
POST /api/properties

Input:

{

Price must be a positive number.

Only the property owner (host) can modify or delete listings.

Image upload size ‚â§ 5MB per file.

Performance Criteria

Listing retrieval time ‚â§ 2 seconds (with filters applied).

API must handle at least 500 simultaneous property queries.

Use Redis caching for popular searches to reduce database load.

üìÖ 3. Booking System Module
Functional Requirements

Guests can book available properties.

Prevent overlapping bookings (date validation).

Support booking cancellation (with status update).

Automatically update property availability after successful booking.

API Endpoints

Booking API should process up to 200 concurrent requests without failure.

Use database transactions to ensure data consistency.

Would you like me to add the ‚ÄúPayment Integration‚Äù as a fourth module (including interaction with Stripe/PayPal and webhook handling)? It complements the Booking System very well and makes the documentation complete for your backend project.
